		<p>She decided to put on the ring as she journeyed to the top of the mountain. The climb was tough, and Zina faced many obstacles along the way. But she persevered, and finally reached the summit.<br> On reaching the top of the mountain, she met an old woman who told her about her past and asked her to always put on the ring whenever she needs help.</p>
		<p>As she stood at the top of the mountain, Zina felt a sense of accomplishment and wonder. She gazed out at the breathtaking view and realized that she had achieved her dream of adventure. <br>From that day on, Zina continued to explore new places and have many more thrilling experiences as she was grateful for the ring of power which made her famous.</p>
